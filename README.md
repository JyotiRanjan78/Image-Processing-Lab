## Introduction

In this course, we explore the fundamentals of image processing and apply various techniques to process and analyze digital images. Each lab in this repository provides hands-on experience with different image processing concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the lab codes, make sure you have the following software installed:

- MATLAB (version R2022a or higher)
- Simulink (version R2022a or higher)

## Lab List

1. Image and Operations.

2. Image Processing using Simulink

3. Image Quantization and Image Sampling

4. Spatial Domain Image Enhancement

5. Filtering based Image enhancement in spatial domain

6. Frequency Domain Image Processing

7. Morphological Image Processing


## Usage

-  Clone the repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/JyotiRanjan78/Image-Processing-Lab.git```

- Navigate to the desired lab directory (e.g., /MATLAB Codes/EXPT_5_1) and open the MATLAB script.

- Run the MATLAB script in the MATLAB environment or execute specific functions as needed.

## MATLAB and Simulink Versions

The lab codes are written and tested on MATLAB and Simulink version R2022a. Compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.
